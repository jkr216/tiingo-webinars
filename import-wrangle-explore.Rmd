### What is tiingo? 

Tiingo was formed in 2014 and holds that belief that love is the ideal way to conduct business. We are a team made up of artists, engineers, and algorithmic hedge fund traders.  More description from Rishi.

### What is R and RStudio? 

R is an open-source statistical programming language that is growing very fast in the world of data science. 

To download R, go to: 

https://cloud.r-project.org

and then click on the link for either Mac, Windows or Linux depending on your computer. 

To install RStudio, go to: 

http://www.rstudio.com/download

RStudio is an integrated development environment (or IDE) for R programming. It makes writing and running R code more fun. 

If all of that is a bit confusing, have a look at this section from *R for Data Science*: 

r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#prerequisites


### Packages

R the programming language consists of base R and the packages that have been built on top of it. Once you have downloaded base R onto your computer and installed RStudio, you need to install the packages we will be using for this workshop.

To install a package on your computer, run `install.packages("name of package")`. To use that package, place `library(name of package)` at the top of your R script or RMarkdown file and run it.

Here are the commands to get the packages for today's workshop.


### Rmarkdown

The file we are looking at and using today is called an `RMarkdown` file. It's a file format that let's us interweave code chunks that look like this: 

```{r}
plot(mtcars)
```

Along with plain text prose, which is what we are reading right now. We can then `knit` this to a PDF, an HTML file or a Notebook. We could have used an R script, which would have the file extension `.R`. Click `file` -> `New File` -> `R Script` to open an R script. Click `file` -> `New File` -> `R Notebook` to open an Rmarkdown Notebook.

### Load the packages
All my R Notebooks start with this step. We need our tools! 

```{r setup, include = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# I have already loaded up these packages so we don't have to wait. 
# If you were starting this project fresh on a new computer, would need to remove the 
# '#' from each line and then run the lines of code to install the packages.

# install.packages("tidyverse")
# install.packaged("highcharter")
# install.packages("tidyquant")
# install.packages("slide")
# install.packages("tidymodels")
# install.packages("timetk")
# install.packages("corrr")
# install.packages("plotly")
# install.packages("scales")
# install.packages("readxl")
# install.packages("cowplot")
# install.packages("riingo")

# or

# 
# for (pkg in c('tidyquant', 'tidyverse', 'plotly', 'highcharter', 'timetk', 'corrr', 'scales', 'tidymodels', 'tibbletime', 'readxl')) 
#   if (!requireNamespace(pkg)) install.packages(pkg)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyquant)
library(timetk)
library(slide)
library(readxl)
library(corrr)
library(scales)
library(plotly)
library(riingo)
library(tidyr)

price_volume_tiingo <- read_rds("price_volume_tiingo.RDS")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, comment = NA)
riingo_set_token("97d26898fe27141ef524c1fa3ab0d3f0c3c59b09")
```

```{r , eval = FALSE}
# I have already loaded up these packages so we don't have to wait. 
# If you were starting this project fresh on a new computer, would need to remove the 
# '#' from each line and then run the lines of code to install the packages.

# install.packages("tidyverse")
# install.packaged("highcharter")
# install.packages("tidyquant")
# install.packages("slide")
# install.packages("tidymodels")
# install.packages("timetk")
# install.packages("corrr")
# install.packages("plotly")
# install.packages("scales")
# install.packages("readxl")
# install.packages("cowplot")
# install.packages("riingo")

# or

# 
# for (pkg in c('tidyquant', 'tidyverse', 'plotly', 'highcharter', 'timetk', 'corrr', 'scales', 'tidymodels', 'tibbletime', 'readxl')) 
#   if (!requireNamespace(pkg)) install.packages(pkg)

### Our data for today

Our data for today == price and volume data for several ETFs 

    + "SPY"
    + "EFA"
    + "IJS"
    + "EEM"
    + "AGG"
    + "TLT"
    + "VNQ"
    + "UUP"

How, why, where did it come from? 

Often this will involve grabbing data from internal databases, or from a repository set up by a vendor, or from someone emailing us excel and csv files.

For today, we will import one local excel file, one local csv file and later will look at how to unzip csv files that are publicly available on the internet.

Before getting to code, click on the file and notice how to use the `Import Dataset` button at the top right. This can be a huge time saver and it generates code for us!

Always, always, paste the full code into the script. Future you will thank past you.

`r stamp("Created Tuesday August 1, 2017 at 12:00")(now())`


### Import data from Tiingo

We will use the `riingo` package to import data from Tiingo. `riingo` is an R package that access the Tiingo API but let's use convenient R functions to do so. Instead of learning how to parse an API, we use a function called `riingo_prices()`.

We do first we need to create an API key so that we can be verified as a user on Tiingo. 

`riingo` makes that quite convenient if you haven't already signed up.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
riingo_browse_signup()
# This requires that you are signed in on the site once you sign up
riingo_browse_token() 
```

Or we can go to tiingo.com, signup and grab our API key.

Now set your token for this session:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Need an API key for tiingo

riingo_set_token("your API key here")
```

```{r}
riingo_set_token("your tiingo api key here")
```

Now we are ready to import our data. We have a few tickers that we'd like to work with today, let's save those as a vector and name it `symbols`. 



```{r}
symbols <- c("XLY", "AGG", "SPY", "EEM", "XLB", "IJS")
```

Now we can pass that `symbols` vector to `riingo_prices()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
price_volume_tiingo <- 
symbols %>% 
  riingo_prices( 
         start_date  = "2007-01-01",
         end_date = today())

price_volume_tiingo %>% 
  group_by(ticker) %>% 
  slice(1)
```

It's not necessary but after I import data, I like to save a copy, just in case. We can do that with a function called `write_rds()`. `RDS` is an R data format.

```{r}
# write_rds(price_volume_tiingo, "price_volume_tiingo.RDS")

```


### What's that weird `%>%`?

```{r}
price_volume_tiingo %>% 
  head()
```


This is called the 'pipe' operator. It chains together our functions so we don't have to create new objects each time we do something. It will appear dozens of times today and by the end you'll be tired of seeing it. We can think of this as reading `and then`, it tells the code to keep processing and moving to the next function. 

We think it makes code more readable and logical, and it saves us from having to create new variable at each line.

Let's do a little wrangling of our data and get familiar with three important functions: `select()`, `slice()` and `filter()`.

We currently have the following columns.

```{r}
price_volume_tiingo %>% 
  colnames()
```

For the rest of today, let's work with jsut the ticker, date, close and volume. To keep just those columns, we use `select()`

```{r}
price_volume_tiingo %>% 
  select(ticker, date, close, volume)
```

Hmmm, what if we've forgotten or don't know all the tickers in that ticker column. We can inspect in two ways. 

The `distinct()` function will pull out unique values from the `ticker` column.

```{r}
price_volume_tiingo %>% 
  select(ticker, date, close, volume) %>% 
  distinct(ticker)
```

Or we can use a combination of `group_by()` and `slice(1)`.

```{r}
price_volume_tiingo %>% 
  select(ticker, date, close, volume) %>% 
  group_by(ticker) %>% 
  slice(1)
```

I prefer the slice method because it returns all the columns. We can grab, say, the first and last observation of each group. 

```{r}
price_volume_tiingo %>% 
  select(ticker, date, close, volume) %>% 
  group_by(ticker) %>% 
  slice(1, n())
```

Let's imagine that we wish to exclude `AGG` from today's project. We can `filter()` that ticker out of our data. 

```{r}
price_volume_tiingo %>% 
  select(ticker, date, close, volume) %>% 
  filter(ticker != "AGG")
```

And perhaps we wish to also exclude any observations from 2018 and 2019 - potentially as a holdout set of data to test any models etc. We can also `filter()` to just dates before "2018-01-01".

```{r}
price_volume_tiingo %>% 
  select(ticker, date, close, volume)  %>% 
  filter(ticker != "AGG" & date < "2018-01-01") %>% 
  tail()
```

```{r}
price_volume_tiingo %>% 
  select(ticker, date, close, volume) %>% 
  filter(ticker != "AGG" & date < "2018-01-01") %>% 
  group_by(ticker) %>% 
  slice(1, n())
```

Finally, I'd like to add a new column to this data frame that holds the daily returns of each of our tickers. We do that with `mutate()`, which lets us add a new column that is a function of existing columns. 

```{r}
price_volume_tiingo %>% 
  select(ticker, date, close, volume) %>% 
  filter(ticker != "AGG" & date < "2018-01-01") %>% 
  group_by(ticker) %>% 
  mutate(daily_returns = close/lag(close, 1) - 1) %>% 
  slice(1, n())
```


Let's create a new data object that excludes `AGG` and the years `2018` and `2019`.

```{r}
price_volume_returns <- 
price_volume_tiingo %>% 
  select(ticker, date, close, volume) %>% 
  filter(ticker != "AGG" & date < "2018-01-01") %>% 
  group_by(ticker) %>% 
   mutate(daily_returns = close/lag(close, 1) - 1)
```

We have now reviewed the most widely used data wrangling functions for data frames: 
    
    + `select()`
    + `filter()`
    + `slice()`
    + `group_by()`
    + `mutate()`

### data visualization

Let's start with `ggplot2`

A little background

    + part of the tidyverse and works well with tidy data
    + grammar of graphics
    + most popular data vis package
    + layers and geoms
    
Why visualize now? All we did was import some data: 

   + find errors or missing data now
   + start getting to know our data
   
Let's create a line chart of prices, first on one chart, then with an individual panel for each symbol.

```{r}
price_volume_returns %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = close, color = ticker)) +
  geom_line()
```

```{r}
price_volume_returns %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = volume, color = ticker)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  facet_wrap(~ticker, scales = "free")
```

How about a scatter plot?

```{r}
price_volume_returns %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = volume, y = daily_returns, color = ticker)) +
 # ggplot(aes(x = date, y = price, color = ticker)) +
  geom_point() +
 theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  facet_wrap(~ticker, scales = "free")
```

### Interactve charting with plotly

The magical `ggplotly()` function makes it fast to get started with plotly. We can convert our `ggplots` to interactive. Not perfect, but efficient.

```{r}
ggplotly(
price_volume_returns %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = close, color = ticker)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))# +
  #facet_wrap(~ticker, scales = "free")
)
```


### Add labels to our data

Create a new data frame with `tibble()` and peek at results with `slice()`. 

```{r}
labels <- 
tibble(
ticker = symbols,
category = c("tech", "bond", "market", "emerging", "materials",  "small_cap")
)

price_volume_returns_lbl <-
price_volume_returns %>% 
  left_join(labels, by = "ticker") %>% 
  mutate(vol_label = case_when(mean(volume) > 5000000 ~ "high volume", 
                                TRUE ~ "low vol"))

price_volume_returns_lbl %>% 
  slice(1, n())

```

So far, we have: 

    + imported data from tiingo
    + made sure the dates were in a good format
    + done some quick exploratory visualization
    + added labels for sectors and volume
